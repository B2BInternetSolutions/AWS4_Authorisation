# AWS4_Authorisation
.NET  class to Add AWS4 Authorisation Header to an HttpRequest

I spent a lot of time looking for a .NET code example for generating an AWS4 Authorization Header for use with the AWS API-Gateway.
I hope that somebody might find this useful.

Sorry its in vb at the moment, it was added to a very large legacy project. I will be creating a C# version as soon as I get time.
